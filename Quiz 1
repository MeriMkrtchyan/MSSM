There are many arguments against using the decision tree with the given information.
Thus, even though the model has 83.7% accuracy we can not be sure that we can or should trust and use the model.

1. The ranking of the decision tree is driven by Gini coefficient or Entropy. 
Neither Gini nor Entropy has any scientific proof to be based on.

2.The decision tree is not evaluated on the whole dataset, that is every variaible is ranked independently 
while depending on the previous instances.Every variable in the tree is forced to interact with every variable further up the tree.

3. The accuracy of the variables is unknown. 
There is no information about the variables that have been used in analyzing the decision tree model.

4. The desision tree is non-parametric that is the model can not be interpreted using P values or betas.
As a result the probabilites of any poseible outcome can not be generated.

5. At each level, tree looks for binary split. This is a greedy algorithm and achieves only local optima.

6. Last but not least, there is a problem with overfitting. 
The model can work with only this given dataset while have large variance with other dataset.
The achived number can not be used as general outcome for all datasets.
