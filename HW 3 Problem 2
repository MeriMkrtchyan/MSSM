Raymond Reddington (known as well as Red) is a data scientist who aims to predict whether a given individual will
conduct another crime or not, based on his/her criminal behavior history. He is using a basic Classification and
Regression Tree (CART) algorithm, which achieves 74.56% ROC AUC on the training set and only 59.83% ROC AUC
on the test set. What would you advice Mr. Red to do to improve his model performance? Please, provide at least
3 recommendations with grounded explanation.

Sample Answer
I would recommend Red to:
1. Tune the tree, if he has not done so yet (or tune more with larger set of parameters), as it clearly overfits
the Train set. Probably he has not tuned, as the text suggest that his tree is basic.
2. Assuming that basic tree uses default parameters, I would suggest to balance the classes. If data is
unbalanced (which probably should be the case of criminal data), then ROC AUC score will suffer from it.
3. Last but not least, I would recommend to use simpler model such as Logistic Regression, as it is less
probably to overfit and easier to tune than the tree.
